const FAQ_DATA = [
  {
    id: "faq-what-is-included",
    q: "What's actually included in a web development services engagement?",
    a: "A full engagement covers discovery and information architecture, custom UI design, front-end and back-end build, content migration, on-page SEO setup (schema, meta data, sitemap), cross-browser and cross-device QA, deployment, and a post-launch support window. You get source code ownership, not a locked-down page builder account.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-timeline",
    q: "How long does a business or e-commerce website take to build?",
    a: "A standard business website typically takes 3 to 6 weeks from signed scope to launch. An e-commerce storefront with payment gateway integration and inventory sync usually runs 6 to 10 weeks. Larger content-driven sites on a headless CMS, or projects needing custom integrations, can run 10 to 16 weeks depending on scope.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-tech-stack",
    q: "What technologies do you use to build websites?",
    a: "Front end is typically React with modern CSS, chosen for speed and long-term maintainability. Back-end logic and APIs run on ASP.NET Core or Node.js depending on the project. Data lives in SQL Server, and hosting runs on Azure, AWS, or a managed VPS, whichever fits your budget and traffic profile.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-hosting",
    q: "Do you handle domain, hosting and SSL setup?",
    a: "Yes. We can provision and configure hosting on AWS, Azure or a VPS, set up DNS and domain records, install SSL certificates, and configure a CI/CD pipeline so future updates deploy cleanly instead of through manual file uploads.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-vs-wordpress",
    q: "Should I get a custom-coded site or a WordPress/template build?",
    a: "It depends on your goals. WordPress and page builders are a reasonable, lower-cost option for a simple brochure site with no unusual requirements. We build custom-coded sites when page speed, security, or a specific workflow (custom quoting tools, gated content, non-standard integrations) matters more than the lower up-front cost of a template. We'll tell you honestly which one fits your case.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-ecommerce",
    q: "Can you build a multi-vendor or high-volume e-commerce store?",
    a: "Yes. We build storefronts designed to hold up under concurrent traffic and order volume, with integrations for Stripe, PayPal and regional payment gateways, and inventory that stays in sync in real time rather than through manual reconciliation.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-seo-ready",
    q: "Will the website be SEO-ready when it launches?",
    a: "Every site we ship includes clean semantic HTML5, correct heading hierarchy, JSON-LD schema markup for the relevant entities, optimized Core Web Vitals, an XML sitemap, and proper canonical/meta tag setup. That covers the technical foundation; ongoing keyword targeting and content strategy is a separate, optional service we also offer.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-responsive",
    q: "Is the site fully responsive on mobile and tablet?",
    a: "Yes, every site is built mobile-first and tested across common breakpoints, not just resized down from a desktop layout. Since the majority of organic traffic for most businesses now arrives on mobile, we treat the mobile layout as the primary design, not an afterthought.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-source-code",
    q: "Do we own the source code once the site is delivered?",
    a: "Yes, fully. Once the project is delivered and paid for, all intellectual property and source code rights transfer to you. You get a clean, documented repository on GitHub or GitLab, no proprietary lock-in and no recurring licensing fee tied to us.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-maintenance",
    q: "What happens after the site goes live?",
    a: "Every project includes a 30-day post-launch support window covering bug fixes and monitoring at no extra cost. After that, most clients move onto an ongoing maintenance retainer for updates, security patches and small content changes, though it isn't required.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-redesign",
    q: "Can you redesign an existing site without losing our search rankings?",
    a: "Yes — this is one of the more common projects we take on. We audit the existing site's URL structure and ranking pages first, then map old URLs to new ones with server-side 301 redirects so link equity and rankings carry over instead of resetting to zero.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-remote-collaboration",
    q: "How does collaboration work if we're not in Pakistan?",
    a: "We work with clients across North America, Europe, the UK and the Gulf remotely, using shared project boards, scheduled video check-ins, and overlap hours arranged around your time zone. You get a single point of contact rather than being routed between different people for updates.",

Our job is to hand you something that still performs well a few years from now, not just something that looks right on launch day."
