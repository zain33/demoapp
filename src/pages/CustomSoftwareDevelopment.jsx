 *     their own pillars and are linked out to, not folded in here.
 *  2. Direct-answer paragraph sits under the H1, snippet-quotable, no fluff.

 *     (linked to the pricing page, no invented numbers) → case study → FAQ → CTA.
 *  4. Sibling pillar + Outer Section links are explicit and limited (~8-10 total).
 *  5. Schema: Organization, Service, BreadcrumbList, WebPage, FAQPage.

/* ─── FAQ data ─────────────────────────────────────────────── */
const FAQ_DATA = [
  {
    q: "What do 'software development services' actually include?",
    a: "It covers the full lifecycle of building software that's built specifically for your business: requirements gathering, architecture and database design, the development itself, QA and testing, deployment, and post-launch support. We handle all of these stages in-house rather than subcontracting parts of the build out.",
  },
  {
    q: "What counts as 'custom software' versus buying something off the shelf?",
    a: "If a product like Salesforce, an ERP suite, or a generic SaaS tool already does 80% of what you need without fighting its own workflow, custom software probably isn't the answer — buy the tool. Custom development earns its cost once you're bending an off-the-shelf product into shapes it wasn't designed for, paying for modules you don't use, or stuck waiting on a support ticket for a fix the vendor has no plan to ship. We say this directly on the first call, even when it means recommending against hiring us.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build software from scratch, or use existing frameworks and libraries?",
    a: "Neither extreme. We don't hand-roll infrastructure that's already been solved — authentication, payments, file storage and similar plumbing come from proven libraries and services. What's custom is the business logic: the rules, workflows and data model specific to how your company actually operates. That split keeps the build faster and the long-term maintenance bill lower than a fully bespoke stack.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do software development services cost?",
    a: "It depends entirely on scope, which is why we don't quote a number on this page. A single internal tool replacing a spreadsheet workflow is a very different project from a multi-module ERP system. We walk through cost drivers and engagement models on our pricing and engagement guide, and give a real estimate after a scoping call — not before.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after the software is delivered — do you just disappear?",
    a: "No. Every build ships with a defined post-launch window covering bug fixes and monitoring at no extra cost, and most clients move into either a fixed-term support retainer or a pay-as-needed maintenance arrangement afterward. Software nobody touches for a year tends to break quietly; we'd rather catch that early.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you take over a system another developer or agency built?",
    a: "Yes, and it's a fairly common starting point for us. We run a short code and architecture review first, partly to understand what we're inheriting, partly to be honest about whether it's worth extending or worth rebuilding a specific module. Sometimes the existing code just needs a team that answers emails; sometimes it doesn't, and we'll say so.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do software development services include ongoing maintenance, or is that separate?",
    a: "The initial post-launch support window is included in every project at no extra cost. Ongoing maintenance beyond that — new features, scaling changes, third-party API updates — is a separate, optional retainer, priced based on expected monthly hours rather than bundled into the build cost by default.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which industries do you build software for?",
    a: "Most of our work has been for finance and fintech operations, logistics and supply chain teams, and internal operations tools for mid-sized businesses generally. We're comfortable with regulated data handling requirements where relevant, and we'll tell you upfront if a project falls outside what we're confident building well.",

                <p>
                  Most businesses should not build custom software, and we say that to
                  clients more often than you'd expect. If a spreadsheet, a CRM, or a
                  $30-a-month SaaS tool does the job, buying it will always beat
                  building it. Custom software development services earn their cost
                  once you're past that point — paying for features you never use,
                  working around a workflow the vendor never designed for, or waiting
                  on a support ticket for a fix that will never come because your use
                  case isn't common enough to matter to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have built systems for finance teams tracking compliance data no
                  generic tool handles correctly, for logistics operations
                  coordinating dozens of moving parts across time zones, and for
                  internal teams who were, quite literally, running their business
                  out of a shared spreadsheet that had started crashing under its own
                  weight. In each case the goal was not an impressive-looking product —
                  it was removing a specific, ongoing cost.
                </p>
                <p>

                  compliance filings where a mistake actually costs money. We built
                  QllmDocs as an internal answer to that, then made it available as

              <p>
                We are not going to put a fake price calculator on this page, because the honest
                answer is "it depends on scope," and pretending otherwise doesn't help you plan.
                What we can tell you is what moves the number: how many user roles the system
                needs, whether it integrates with software you already run, how strict your
                compliance requirements are, and whether you need a working version fast or a
                fully-featured one. A single internal tool can be a matter of weeks; a
                multi-module operations platform is a matter of months. For a breakdown of how we
                structure pricing and engagement models, see our{" "}
                <Link to="/software-development-cost-calculator">pricing and engagement guide</Link>, or
                just tell us your project and we'll give you a real number.

          title="Why I Still Review Every Architecture Decision Myself"
          message="Most of the damage in custom software happens quietly, in decisions nobody questions until the bill comes due — a data model that can't scale, a shortcut that becomes permanent, a dependency nobody planned to maintain. I review the architecture on every project we take on personally, not because our engineers need supervision, but because catching a bad decision in week two costs an afternoon, and catching it in month eight costs a rebuild. That review is the one step I haven't delegated, and I don't plan to."
