 * Links UP to:            /web-application-development-services (Core pillar)
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a duplicate of the Web Application Development pillar.
 * That pillar answers "build me a web application" broadly, across frameworks.
 * This page answers a narrower, technology-qualified question — someone who has
 * already decided (or inherited) ASP.NET Core and wants a team that knows it deeply.
 * Keeping that distinction explicit is what keeps the two pages from cannibalizing

                We'll say upfront: framework choice matters less than most agencies pretend it
                does. ASP.NET Core is a strong pick in a few specific situations, and we'd
                rather you know which one you're in before signing a contract.
